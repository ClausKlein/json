# Overview

The main parts of the JSON library are

* the [Value Class](Value-Class.md) to handle (extended) JSON data in memory,
* the [Events Interface](Events-Interface.md) as universal adapter between different parts of the library (and other libraries), and
* the [Type Traits](Type-Traits.md) to control the interaction between C++ data types and the Value Class and Events Interface.
