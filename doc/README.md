# Preliminary Documentation

This document gives a first introduction to design and usage of the taocpp/json library pending final changes for version 1.0.0.

The taocpp/json library is built around two main concepts, the *Value class* and the *Events interface*.

* [Value Class](Value-Class.md)
* [Events Interface](Events-Interface.md)
